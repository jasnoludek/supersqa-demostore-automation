## Overview

Thi project builds upon the skills learned from the "Selenium Webdriver Crash
Course" on Udemy by Admas Kinfu. The course introduced basic concepts and
tutorials for performing test cases using Seleniium Webdriver. After completing
the course, this project extended the learning by:

- Writing a comprehensive test plan
- Creating additional test cases
- Implementing the Page Object Model
- Using the unittest framework
- Managing the project using Jira
- Gaining experience in writing bug reports

## Key Features

- Utilized Page Object Model for better code organization and maintainability.
- Employed the unittest framework for structuring and running tests.
- Created a comprehensive test plan to guide testing efforts.
- Managed the project and tracked progress using Jira.
- Generated bug reports with clear details and steps to reproduce.
- Integrated various concepts to perform an end-to-end purchase flow.
